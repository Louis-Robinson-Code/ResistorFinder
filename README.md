# ResistorFinder
Placing Bounding Boxes Round Resistors in an image. 
The projects aim is to locate resistors in a set dataset provide and identify their resistance levels.
So far I have managed to use HSV to segment the resistors from the background and place bounding boxes round the resistors. This version is not yet capable of segmenting the colour bands to identify resistance.
The next step would be to explore CNN's instead of a HSV's to identify the resistance levels in the resistors.
